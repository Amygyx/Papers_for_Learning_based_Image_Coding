# Papers for Neural Image Compression
**Purpose:** We aim to provide a summary of neural image compression. More papers will be summarized. 

University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), [Intelligent Media Computing Lab](https://faculty.ustc.edu.cn/chenzhibo).

**ðŸ“Œ About new works.** If you want to incorporate your studies (e.g., the link of paper or project) on neural image compression in this repository. Welcome to raise an issue or email us. We will incorporate it into this repository and our survey report as soon as possible.
